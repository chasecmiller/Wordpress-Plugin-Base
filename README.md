# Wordpress-Plugin-Base
A wordpress plugin that contains proper namespaced OOP, autoloading

This file really isn't written to do anything other than stage plugin development.

# How to use:
Namespaces are set.  You may modify them as needed, just make sure to rework any directory names since it's using Composer's autoloader.
Edit Plugin.php's header.
